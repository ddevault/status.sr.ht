# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Folks like you are more than welcome!

## I want to suggest something, report a bug, etc.

[Please create an issue](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues)!

## I want to write code.

First of all:

**Never merge to master. Merge to dev.**

Some guidelines. You want to make sure that you have:

* Looked, if there was an issue for the thing you are trying to achieve
* If there isn't, create one and discuss your proposal in that issue.

The code you write should be:

+ working as intended,
+ spaced out instead of being in all one big pile,
+ readable to humans. If it is not immediately obvious, add some comments.
