# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Folks like you are more than welcome!

## I want to suggest something, report a bug, etc.

Cool, [just create an issue](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues)!

## I want to help contribute a new feature.

Great. Here are some things to keep in mind:

+ Keep it as simple as possible.
+ Keep it as light as possible.
+ Try to make it readable.

## Wait, my question has not been answered.

At the time of writing, cState is such a small project that anyone contributing would be a downright miracle. However, if you are a miracle worker, please do redirect any concerns and they will addressed as soon as humanely possible. [Just create an issue](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues)!
