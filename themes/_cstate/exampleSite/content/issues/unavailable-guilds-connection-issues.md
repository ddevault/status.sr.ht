*Post-mortem*

At approximately 14:01, a Redis instance acting as the primary for a highly-available cluster used by our API services was migrated automatically by Google’s Cloud Platform. This migration caused the node to incorrectly drop offline, forcing the cluster to rebalance and trigger known issues with the way our API instances handle Redis failover. After resolving this partial outage, unnoticed issues on other services caused a cascading failure through Example Chat App’s real time system. These issues caused enough critical impact that Example Chat App’s engineering team was forced to fully restart the service, reconnecting millions of clients over a period of 20 minutes.

*Update* - A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results. Looks like this has been fixed. {{< track "2018-04-13 17:30:00" >}}

*Monitoring* - After hitting the ole reboot button Example Chat App is now recovering. We're going to continue to monitor as everyone reconnects. {{< track "2018-04-13 16:50:00" >}}

*Investigating* - We're aware of users experiencing unavailable guilds and issues when attempting to connect. We're currently investigating. {{< track "2018-04-13 15:54:00" >}}
