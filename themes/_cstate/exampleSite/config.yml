# Welcome to the cState configuration file!
#
# If you are using an earlier version, or one
# in the future, such as v8.0 you may see errors
# pop up when deploying a cState website.
#
# Now, onto the fun part.
#
# Hugo is used for building the status page,
# so this file can be used to change how
# your status page should behave or look.
#
# If you want to use special characters,
# such as accented letters, you MUST save
# the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
#
# If cState does not load, ensure that:
#  - No tabs are present;
#    YAML only allows spaces
#  - Indents are correct
#    YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#  - You have "escaped" all apostrophes
#    in your text: If you want to write "don't",
#    for example, write "don''t" instead!
#    Note the doubled apostrophe.
#  - Text with symbols is enclosed in single
#    or double quotation marks.
#
# If you have problems, create an issue on GitHub:
# https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues

# What is your status page called?
# Shows up in the browser bar and meta tags
title: Eggsample Status

# Should posts, which have a publish date
# from the future, be built? Useful for
# sharing upcoming maintenance, etc.
#
# We recommend to keep this at `true`.
# BOOLEAN; `true`, `false`
buildFuture: true

# What language do you want to use for the
# html[lang] definition?
#
# Does not change language of site
# itself.
#
# Default: `en`
# ISO 639-1 defines abbreviations.
#
# See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
# Also: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp
languageCode: en

# What translation file should cState use?
# You can also define whether missing
# translations should get placeholders.
#
# For defaultContentLanguage—
# Default: `en`
#
# For enableMissingTranslationPlaceholders—
# do not set it to true for languages other
# than English! When tested with Lithuanian,
# it would add unnecesary placeholders to
# values that were intentionally empty.
defaultContentLanguage: en

# What is the hostname or path to the root?
# Where is the site hosted?
#
# ❗ cState & Hugo don’t support '/' in
# production use. It will break RSS
# feeds and breaks permalinks since
# version 3. If you are just testing,
# localhost should automatically work.
#
# Example: https://status.example.com/
baseURL: https://cstate.mnts.lt

params:
  # Before setting up your systems, you need
  # to first define at least one category.
  #
  # Categories are shown in the order that
  # you define in this config file.
  #
  # Categories can have a:
  # - name
  # - description
  # - closed boolean `closed: true`
  #   That would collapse the category upon first load
  #   and the user can expand by clicking on the category
  #   (Requires JavaScript.)
  # - untitled boolean `untitled: true`
  #   This would complerely hide the name of the category.
  #   This is useful, if you do not want to use categories
  #   because you need to set an 'Uncategorized' category.
  #   Or it can be used alongside other categories.
  #
  # For help, see the wiki:
  # https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki/Customization

  # Google Analytics tracking code

  # To disable the analytics, change

  # Default: UA-00000000-1
