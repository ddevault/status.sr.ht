# Code of Conduct

> TL;DR is to be a good, sensible person. It does not matter who you are, this rule applies to _everybody_.

This community as a whole, much like others, is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the project at hand. Diversity can be a strength, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies to all spaces managed by the project creators equally.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended — a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

+ **Be friendly and patient.** Use common sense, treat others like you would want to be treated. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person, especially personally.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting violent material, such as sexually explicit content.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
+ **Be welcoming and considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users, so you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that the internet stretches to almost all corners of the world and you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
+ **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of this community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Django community.
+ **When there is disagreement, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, can happen all the time and our community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Django comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

*This Code of Conduct is based upon the [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). If you want to use this Code of Conduct for your project, please feel free to do so!*
