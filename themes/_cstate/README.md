## Getting started 💻

For this tutorial, it is assumed that you have Hugo and Git installed (check with `hugo version` & `git --version`).

> A minimum version of `0.48` is required for Hugo, starting with v3.

#### Production

We encourage you to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for cState. These are the following options you need to change in deploy settings:

+ Build command: **hugo**
+ Publish directory: **public**
+ Add one build environment variable
  + Key: **HUGO_VERSION**
  + Value: **0.48** (or later)

**The easy way**

You can simply click this button to get started:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/cstate/example)

This sets up cState with its default settings from the cstate/example repo.

***

If you want to do this from any branch in this repository, follow the manual instructions:

1. Download the contents of the `exampleSite` directory in this repository. This will be your site guts, which will hold the content and configuration for the status page.
2. Create a `themes` folder and navigate to it on the command line.

```bash
mkdir themes; cd themes;
```
2. Start Git on this folder: 

```bash
git init
```

3. Now simply add a Git submodule pointing to this repository, like so:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/cstate/cstate
```

4. Set up cState for your liking. It is now ready to be used in production.

#### Development

1. Clone this repository in the command line:

```bash
git clone --recursive -b master https://github.com/cstate/cstate.git
```

2. Navigate to the theme directory:

```bash
cd cstate/exampleSite
```

3. Launch the development setup much like this:

```bash
hugo serve --baseUrl=http://localhost/ --theme=cstate --themesDir=../.. --verbose
```

The main directory is the theme itself (the cState guts, basically) and the `exampleSite` folder houses all content. Use this local setup to experiment before deploying to production!

If you would like to commit/make a PR, make sure that `themesDir` is a comment before trying to merge upstream.

## Updating 🎉

**If you are updating from one major version to another, like from v3 to v4, then please [read the migration guides](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki/Usage#migration-guides).**

Assuming the production install instructions were followed, keep cState updated by having an up to date Git submodule in the `themes` folder. containing this repository. Your content will stay separate.

Ask yourself these questions:

1. Do I already have the **up to date** Git repository with my status page on my computer?
  * If not, go to your desktop or somewhere else, where you can download your Git repository and run: `git clone --recursive <your repo link goes here> && git submodule foreach git pull origin master`.
  * In the parent directory, type `hugo serve`. Check to see if everything is working.
  * Then do `git add -A; git commit -m "Update cState"; git push origin master; exit`. Your status page is now updated.
2. If you **DO** have the directory, go inside `themes/cstate`. If that is empty, it is easier to delete your local copy and do the steps outlined earlier.

There is currently no easier way to do this, unfortunately, you will need the terminal / command line / Git Bash, unless you want to create a new status page from scratch and move your data over manually.

## FAQ 🤔

### Are there settings you can change?

Yes, most of the settings are in the `config.yml` file or under _Settings_ in Netlify CMS.

### Where do issues go?

#### Using an admin panel (Netlify CMS)

This takes a little more effort to set up but pays off in the long run — [see the wiki](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki) for up to date information.

#### Doing it from the Git repository

Create a file in `content/issues`. The name of the file will be the slug (what shows up in the URL bar). For example, this is what `2017-02-30-major-outage-east-us.md` should look like:

```md
---
title: Major outage in East US
date: 2017-02-30 14:30:00
resolved: true
resolvedWhen: 2017-02-30 16:00:00
severity: down
affected:
  - API
section: issue
---

*Monitoring* - After hitting the ole reboot button Example Chat App is now recovering. We’re going to continue to monitor as everyone reconnects. {{< track "2018-04-13 16:50:00" >}}

*Investigating* - We’re aware of users experiencing unavailable guilds and issues when attempting to connect. We're currently investigating. {{< track "2018-04-13 15:54:00" >}}
```

Time to break that down.

`title`: This is the one of the most important parts of an incident. *(required)*  
`date`: An ISO-8601 formatted date. Does not include time zone. This is when you first discovered the issue. *(required)*  
`resolved`: Whether issue should affect overall status. Either `true` or `false`. *(boolean, required)*  
`resolvedWhen`: An ISO-8601 formatted date. Does not include time zone. This is when downtime stopped. You may set the time that downtime ended without completely resolving the issue (thus leaving time for monitoring).  
`severity`: If an issue is not resolved, it will have an applied severity. There are 3 levels of severity: `notice`, `disrupted`, and `down`. If there are multiple issues, the status page will take the appearance of the more drastic issue (such as `disrupted` instead of `notice`). *(required)*  
`affected`. Add the items that were present in the config file which should alter the status of each individual system (component). *(array, required)*  
`section`. This must be `issue`, so that Hugo treats it as one. *(required)*
