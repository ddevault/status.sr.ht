**HTTP(s) clone access has been restored**:
The issue was narrowed down to a stale nginx configuration which directed
authorization requests to the wrong port. The configuration has been corrected
and normal service is restored.

**HTTP(s) clone is currently unavailable for hg.sr.ht**:
A planned deployment ran afoul and has caused some problems with cloning
hg.sr.ht repositories via https. An investigation is ongoing. SSH clone is still
working correctly.
