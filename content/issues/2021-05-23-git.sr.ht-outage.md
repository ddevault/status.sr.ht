**Go users may experience issues due to proxy.golang.org's IP addresses being
black holed**. We have been working with the Go team ([thread 1][1], [thread
2][2]) since February to deal with periodic bursts of elevated traffic
originating from sum.golang.org. These bursts have increased continuously since,
peaking at over 1,000 git clones per minute near 20:25 UTC today. This usage
falls far outside of the typical load for git.sr.ht, and caused a brief
git.sr.ht outage. To mitigate the problem and continue providing service for
other git.sr.ht users, the Go proxy IP block has been black holed. Until the Go
team resolves this issue, Go users fetching packages hosted on git.sr.ht may
encounter issues.

**To work around problems with fetching Go modules**, you may set
"GOPROXY=direct" in your environment.
