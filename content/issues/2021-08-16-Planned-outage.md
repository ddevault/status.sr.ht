**Planned maintenance on August 16th will cause intermittent outages**:
We are planning the second (and last phase) of the maintenance which began on
August 3rd. This will affect all services, causing intermittent outages that are
expected to last between 15 and 30 minutes at most. The total maintenance period
should last less than 2 hours.
