**DNS error**:
The builds.sr.ht DNS records were incorrectly updated to the wrong IP address,
resulting in an outage which will last for the duration of the TTL
(approximately 1 hour). A workaround is to add builds.sr.ht to your
`/etc/hosts` file: the correct IP address is `173.195.146.148`. Please set a
reminder to remove this entry, as futute DNS updates may cause local outages for
you if you do not.
