**Service restored**:
Service has been restored. I/O exhaustion flipped git.sr.ht's filesystem into
read-only mode and on reboot, filesystem corruption was found. The integrity of
user data was not affected, and if they were, the integrity of our backups was
found to be correct in an emergency integrity test (routine checks are also
performed regularly and found to be in order).

An investigation into the underlying causes of the failure is ongoing.
