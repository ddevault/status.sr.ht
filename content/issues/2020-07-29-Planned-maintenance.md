**Planned maintenance on July 29th will cause an hg.sr.ht outage**:
At 17:00 UTC on July 29th, we will conduct planned maintenance on hg.sr.ht to
migrate the primary server to newer hardware. It is expected to take no more
than an hour, during which time hg.sr.ht will be available in read-only mode.
