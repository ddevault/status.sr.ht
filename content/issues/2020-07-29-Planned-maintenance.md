**Maintenance complete**. Depending on how soon your DNS server picks up the
updates, you should find service restored shortly.

We're still waiting on the latest data to transfer from the old server to the
new. It is taking longer than we expected. The process is about halfway
complete. We apologise for the delay.

**Planned maintenance on July 29th will cause an hg.sr.ht outage**:
At 17:00 UTC on July 29th, we will conduct planned maintenance on hg.sr.ht to
migrate the primary server to newer hardware. It is expected to take no more
than an hour, during which time hg.sr.ht will be available in read-only mode.
