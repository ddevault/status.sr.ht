**An ongoing issue with our upstream network provider is causing chat.sr.ht
reliability problems**:
An issue with our network provider is causing some unreliability for our
services. The full extent of the problem is still not known, but the most
important consequence of it so far is that chat.sr.ht connections to upstream
networks are unreliable. You may experience disconnections and intermittent
service.
