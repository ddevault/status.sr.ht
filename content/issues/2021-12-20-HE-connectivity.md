**The issue has been resolved**:
The upstream network has corrected the problem. Normal service should be
restored. Over the course of 19 minutes, we dropped 10 of our ~500 upstream
chat.sr.ht connections. We are still experiencing internal issues, but they are
not service impacting and we expect them to clear up shortly.

**An ongoing issue with our upstream network provider is causing chat.sr.ht
reliability problems**:
An issue with our network provider is causing some unreliability for our
services. The full extent of the problem is still not known, but the most
important consequence of it so far is that chat.sr.ht connections to upstream
networks are unreliable. You may experience disconnections and intermittent
service.
