**Advances in the pace of disk usage on git.sr.ht has increased the urgency of a
planned migration**. On September 18th, [we were tracking][sr.ht-dev] the growth
of git.sr.ht disk space usage up to an expected disk space exhaustion in
November. However, in the intervening time, the rate of growth has accellerated
and we are now urgently seeking to migrate to a server we have prepped with more
storage space. This may cause disruptions as git.sr.ht may become read-only
during the migration process.
